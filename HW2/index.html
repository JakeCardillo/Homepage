      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> I am a senior Computer Science student at UMASS Lowell.
      My focus is in Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning. During my
      time at UML I've had a chance to work on some interesting and difficult projects,
      such as writing my own programming language from scratch, and designing my own
      platformer game and creating an AI that can solve it in an efficient way.
      <br> <br>
      In the future I hope to work on products that involve AI in non-Computer Science fields.
      I like automating tasks that occur in real life and finding ways to make my life more efficient
      and I think that I would enjoy doing that for a job. I also have an interest in machining and CNC
      work so that will probably be my focus.
      <br> <br>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing the drums, painting, and reading. I have also started
      repairing antique hand tools that my grandfather collects.</p>
