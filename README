In this assignment I updated my homepage to use bootstrap. To start, I used the 
W3 schools "Webpage" template available here:
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_temp_webpage&stacked=h

I customized the template to include the information from my old website and adjusted the
look to how I wanted it. I added links to all of the homeworks along the top navbar and 
added links to my GitHub and LinkedIn on the left side. I removed the space for ads because 
I obviously won't have ads on my site but I think that the layout of the website looked better
with that right side blocked off. I may add pictures there in the future. I also included my 
contact information in the footer at the bottom.
