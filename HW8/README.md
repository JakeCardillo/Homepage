In this assignment I implemented one line of drag and drop scrabble.
The player can drag a tile from their rack to a board space and once they have
created a word longer than 2 letters, they can submit the word. A highscore
is also displayed.

Some content in this file and script.js has been adapted from w3 schools examples
and examples from the jQuery wiki
